#This report quantifies how technology-enabled reductions in the burden of travel may affect residential location choices, using the Puget #Sound (Washington) region as a case study. The work generally follows the outline proposed in the final report from FY2016 (Jabbari, #Wang, & MacKenzie 2016), which presented a plan for quantifying how changes in the value of travel time could affect the probability of #households choosing to live in different types of neighborhoods. The general approach is to estimate a multinomial logit residential #location choice model that incorporates the value of travel time via two measures of accessibility. This report summarizes the results of #this process for the Puget Sound Region, which has involved calculating and mapping accessibility under current and future conditions #with a reduced value of travel time, then calculating a latent class logit residential choice model based on these results.
